# SHALA2020
This repository contains the assignments solved by me for the SHALA programme.  SHALA is an amazing project carried out by Prof. Amit Sethi (EE, IITB) and his colleagues. The SHALA (Stay at Home And Learn AI) programme aims to teach students the concepts of AI in a rigorous manner by giving lectures, tutorials, programming and maths assignments. 

I am grateful to Prof. Amit Sethi and his team for rendering such service to enthusiatic students and professionals alike.
